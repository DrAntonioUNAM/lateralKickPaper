# lateralKickPaper
This repository contains the datasets generated and analyzed in the study “[Title of the Article]”. The data consist of comma-separated value (CSV) files derived from videogrammetry and inertial sensing during the execution of karate lateral kicks. The dataset includes kinematic variables in sagittal and frontal planes, acceleration signals acquired using an MPU6050 sensor, and derived measures used for biomechanical and wavelet-based analyses.

Data are organized by participant expertise level and experimental condition (target distance). All files are provided in raw and processed form, accompanied by metadata describing coordinate systems, units, sampling rates, and processing steps. The dataset is intended to support transparency, reproducibility, and reuse in biomechanics, sports science, and human-movement analysis research.

The version associated with the published article corresponds to GitHub release v1.0.0 archived in Zenodo. Subsequent updates are provided as newer releases.
